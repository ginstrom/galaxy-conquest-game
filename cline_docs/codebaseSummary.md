## Configuration Management
- Added TOML-based configuration system
- `config.toml` allows overriding default settings
- Supports hierarchical configuration with sections:
  * Debug settings
  * Logging configuration
  * Game display parameters
  * Galaxy generation settings
- Configuration precedence:
  1. Command-line arguments (highest priority)
  2. `config.toml` file
  3. Default settings in `settings.py` (lowest priority)

## Key Components

### Resource Management
- ResourceManager: Handles game assets and caching
- TextCache: Optimizes text rendering
- Mock objects for testing without hardware dependencies

### Game Views
- GalaxyView: Main galaxy map
- SystemView: Individual star system view
- PlanetView: Detailed planet information
- StartupView: Game initialization and menu
- InfoPanel: Base class for information panels
  - GalaxyViewInfoPanel: Information panel for galaxy view
  - SystemViewInfoPanel: Information panel for system view
  - PlanetViewInfoPanel: Information panel for planet view

### Testing Infrastructure
- Mock objects for pygame components
- Dependency injection for hardware independence
- High test coverage with detailed assertions

## Recent Changes
- [2025-02-25] Unified hover handling for planets and systems
  - Created a new `hover_utils.py` module with common hover detection functions:
    - `check_hover`: A generic function to check if the mouse is hovering over any object
    - `is_within_circle`: A helper function to check if the mouse is within a circular object
  - Updated hover detection in the main game loop to use the common functions
  - Updated the `SystemView.update()` method to use the common functions
  - Added `update()` methods to `PlanetView` and `GalaxyView` classes for consistency
  - Improved code maintainability and reduced duplication
  - Made the codebase more consistent and easier to extend
- [2025-02-25] Implemented planet hover functionality in system view
  - Added hover detection in SystemView to track when the mouse is over a planet
  - Updated Game class to include a `hovered_planet` attribute
  - Modified SystemViewInfoPanel to display information about the hovered planet
  - Added tests to verify the hover functionality works correctly
  - Enhanced user experience by providing immediate feedback when hovering over planets
  - Improved information display without requiring user clicks

- [2025-02-25] Added Makefile system for common development tasks
  - Created a Makefile with targets for running the game and tests
  - Added `setup` target for easy environment setup and dependency installation

  - Updated documentation to reference the Makefile commands
  - Improved developer experience and simplified common workflows

- [2025-02-25] Restructured project documentation
  - Made README.md more concise with links to detailed documentation
  - Created a `docs` directory with detailed documentation files:
    - installation.md: Detailed installation instructions
    - project_structure.md: Detailed project structure information
    - configuration.md: Configuration options and usage
    - testing.md: Testing approach and instructions
    - contributing.md: Guidelines for contributing

  - Updated projectRoadmap.md to reflect current progress and next steps
  - Updated codebaseSummary.md with latest changes and testing improvements
  - Aligned documentation with the current state of the codebase

- [2025-02-25] Improved test coverage for InfoPanel classes
  - Added comprehensive unit tests for InfoPanel base class and subclasses
  - Created integration tests for view classes and their InfoPanel instances
  - Updated MockGame and MockBackground classes to support testing
  - Fixed edge cases and improved test robustness
  - Increased overall test coverage to 82% (above the 80% target)
  - Completed all planned testing tasks for InfoPanel classes

- [2025-02-25] Fixed unit tests for PlanetView
  - Added `info_panel` attribute to MockGame class in tests/mocks.py
  - Updated MockFont class to provide a default size value (24) when none is specified
  - Fixed AttributeError in test_planet_view_initialization
  - Fixed TypeError in test_planet_view_draw_with_planet
  - All tests now pass successfully with 73% code coverage

- [2025-02-25] Added view-specific InfoPanel instances to each view
  - Added a `panel` member to each view class (GalaxyView, SystemView, PlanetView)
  - Each view now has its own InfoPanel subclass instance
  - Updated drawing logic to use `self.panel.draw(screen)` in each view
  - Removed central `info_panel` from Game class
  - Improved encapsulation by having each view manage its own panel
  - Better separation of responsibilities and more maintainable code structure

- [2025-02-25] Implemented draw logic in InfoPanel subclasses
  - Added view-specific drawing logic to each InfoPanel subclass:
    - GalaxyViewInfoPanel: Displays hovered system info or galaxy stats
    - SystemViewInfoPanel: Shows selected system info and planet details
    - PlanetViewInfoPanel: Presents detailed planet information
  - Each subclass now handles its specific view state appropriately
  - Completed the InfoPanel refactoring for better separation of concerns

- [2025-02-25] Refactored InfoPanel into a class hierarchy
  - Created InfoPanel base class with common functionality
  - Added specialized subclasses for each game view:
    - GalaxyViewInfoPanel: For galaxy-specific information
    - SystemViewInfoPanel: For system-specific information
    - PlanetViewInfoPanel: For planet-specific information
