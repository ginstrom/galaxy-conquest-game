## Key Components

### Resource Management
- ResourceManager: Handles game assets and caching
- TextCache: Optimizes text rendering
- Mock objects for testing without hardware dependencies

### Game Views
- GalaxyView: Main galaxy map
- SystemView: Individual star system view
- PlanetView: Detailed planet information
- StartupView: Game initialization and menu

### Testing Infrastructure
- Mock objects for pygame components
- Dependency injection for hardware independence
- High test coverage with detailed assertions

## Recent Changes
- [2025-02-17] Added comprehensive logging to view classes
  - View transitions and state changes
  - User input handling (keyboard/mouse)
  - Error conditions and edge cases
  - Removed verbose drawing logs
- [2025-02-17] Implemented dependency injection for testing
  - Added MockSurface, MockFont, MockSound classes
  - Improved test stability and reliability
  - Achieved 83% code coverage
  - Fixed pygame initialization issues

## Component Details

### Mock Objects
- MockSurface: Tracks drawing operations and color state
- MockFont: Simulates text rendering without initialization
- MockSound: Handles audio simulation
- MockPygame: Provides complete pygame module simulation

### Resource System
- Efficient asset loading and caching
- Hardware-independent testing support
- Improved error handling and logging

### View System
- Clear separation of concerns
- Testable rendering logic
- Mock-friendly architecture
- Comprehensive logging system
  - View transitions and state changes
  - User input handling (keyboard/mouse)
  - Error conditions and edge cases

## Testing Coverage
- game/background.py: 100%
- game/menu.py: 79%
- game/star_system.py: 95%
- game/resources.py: 75%
- Overall coverage: 83%

## Future Improvements
1. Testing
   - Increase coverage in galaxy.py and system.py
   - Add more edge case testing
   - Improve mock object capabilities

2. Architecture
   - Further component isolation
   - Enhanced dependency injection
   - Better error handling

3. Documentation
   - Expand mock object documentation
   - Add testing guidelines
   - Update component interaction docs
