## Configuration Management
- Added TOML-based configuration system
- `config/prefs.toml` allows overriding default settings
- Supports hierarchical configuration with sections:
  * Debug settings
  * Logging configuration
  * Game display parameters
  * Galaxy generation settings
- Configuration precedence:
  1. Command-line arguments (highest priority)
  2. `config/prefs.toml` file
  3. Default settings in `settings.py` (lowest priority)

## Key Components

### Resource Management
- ResourceManager: Handles game assets and caching
- TextCache: Optimizes text rendering
- Mock objects for testing without hardware dependencies

### Game Views
- GalaxyView: Main galaxy map
- SystemView: Individual star system view
- PlanetView: Detailed planet information
- StartupView: Game initialization and menu
- InfoPanel: Base class for information panels
  - GalaxyViewInfoPanel: Information panel for galaxy view
  - SystemViewInfoPanel: Information panel for system view
  - PlanetViewInfoPanel: Information panel for planet view

### Testing Infrastructure
- Mock objects for pygame components
- Dependency injection for hardware independence
- High test coverage with detailed assertions
