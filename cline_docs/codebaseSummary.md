## Configuration Management
- Added TOML-based configuration system
- `config.toml` allows overriding default settings
- Supports hierarchical configuration with sections:
  * Debug settings
  * Logging configuration
  * Game display parameters
  * Galaxy generation settings
- Configuration precedence:
  1. Command-line arguments (highest priority)
  2. `config.toml` file
  3. Default settings in `settings.py` (lowest priority)

## Key Components

### Resource Management
- ResourceManager: Handles game assets and caching
- TextCache: Optimizes text rendering
- Mock objects for testing without hardware dependencies

### Game Views
- GalaxyView: Main galaxy map
- SystemView: Individual star system view
- PlanetView: Detailed planet information
- StartupView: Game initialization and menu

### Testing Infrastructure
- Mock objects for pygame components
- Dependency injection for hardware independence
- High test coverage with detailed assertions

## Recent Changes

- [2025-02-18] Added handle_input method to StartupView
  - Unified input handling across view classes
  - Added comprehensive test coverage
  - Fixed event handling in menu system
  - Improved code consistency with other views
  - Test coverage for StartupView now at 98%

- [2025-02-18] Consolidated view interfaces
  - All views now implement consistent methods:
    - draw(screen): Renders the view
    - handle_keydown(event): Handles keyboard input
    - handle_click(pos): Handles mouse clicks
  - Improved code consistency and maintainability
  - Added logging for all input events
