## Testing Framework
- pytest: Primary testing framework
- pytest-mock: For mocking and dependency injection
- pytest-cov: For code coverage reporting

## Mock Objects
- MockSurface: Extends pygame.Surface, tracks drawing operations
- MockFont: Simulates text rendering without font initialization
- MockSound: Simulates sound playback without audio hardware
- MockPygame: Complete pygame module mock for hardware independence

## Development Tools
- Python 3.10+
- Poetry: Dependency management
- pygame-ce: Game development library (Community Edition of pygame)
- pygame_gui: UI components
- VSCode: Primary IDE
- Git: Version control

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit Tests:
   - Component isolation through dependency injection
   - Mock objects for hardware-dependent features
   - High test coverage target (80%+)

2. Integration Tests:
   - System-level functionality testing
   - Component interaction verification

3. Test Environment:
   - Automated test suite with Poetry and Makefile support
   - HTML coverage reports

## Dependencies
### Core
- pygame-ce: Game engine and graphics (Community Edition of pygame)
- pygame_gui: UI components
- numpy: Numerical computing
- scipy: Scientific computing and statistical distributions
- toml: Configuration file parsing

### Development
- pytest: Testing framework
- pytest-mock: Mocking support
- pytest-cov: Coverage reporting
- black: Code formatting (managed outside Poetry)
- pylint: Code linting (managed outside Poetry)

## Dependency Management
- Poetry: Modern Python dependency management
  - Manages virtual environments
  - Handles dependency resolution
  - Provides consistent builds
  - Simplifies package publishing
  - Separates development and production dependencies

## Architecture
### Components
- Resource Management: Asset loading and caching
- View System: Game state rendering
- Event System: Input handling
- Game Logic: Core gameplay mechanics

### Testing Architecture
- Mock Objects: Hardware independence
- Dependency Injection: Component isolation
- Test Fixtures: Reusable test setup
