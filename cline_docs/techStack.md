## Testing Framework
- pytest: Primary testing framework
- pytest-mock: For mocking and dependency injection
- pytest-cov: For code coverage reporting

## Mock Objects
- MockSurface: Extends pygame.Surface, tracks drawing operations
- MockFont: Simulates text rendering without font initialization
- MockSound: Simulates sound playback without audio hardware
- MockPygame: Complete pygame module mock for hardware independence

## Development Tools
- Python 3.9+
- pygame: Game development library
- pygame_gui: UI components
- VSCode: Primary IDE
- Git: Version control

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit Tests:
   - Component isolation through dependency injection
   - Mock objects for hardware-dependent features
   - High test coverage target (80%+)

2. Integration Tests:
   - System-level functionality testing
   - Component interaction verification

3. Test Environment:
   - Automated test suite with Makefile support
   - HTML coverage reports
