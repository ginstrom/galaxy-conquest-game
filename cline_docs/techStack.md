## Testing Framework
- pytest: Primary testing framework
- pytest-mock: For mocking and dependency injection
- pytest-cov: For code coverage reporting

## Mock Objects
### MockSurface
- Extends pygame.Surface
- Tracks drawing operations
- Supports color state
- Handles surface conversions and blitting

### MockFont
- Simulates text rendering
- Supports different font sizes
- No font initialization required

### MockSound
- Simulates sound playback
- Tracks play/stop state
- No audio hardware required

### MockPygame
- Complete pygame module mock
- Supports drawing primitives
- Handles initialization flags
- Simulates display and event handling

## Development Tools
- Python 3.9+
- pygame: Game development library
- VSCode: Primary IDE
- Git: Version control

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit Tests:
   - Component isolation through dependency injection
   - Mock objects for hardware-dependent features
   - High test coverage target (80%+)

2. Integration Tests:
   - System-level functionality testing
   - Component interaction verification
   - End-to-end gameplay scenarios

3. Test Environment:
   - Automated test suite
   - Continuous integration ready
   - Reproducible test results
