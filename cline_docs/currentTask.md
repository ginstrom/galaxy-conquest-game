## Current Objective
Implement logging system for Galaxy Conquest game

### Completed Tasks
1. Created logging configuration module:
   - Created `game/logging_config.py` with flexible logging setup
   - Implemented configurable log levels
   - Added utility functions for getting module-specific loggers

2. Added command-line configuration:
   - Added `--log-level` argument to set logging level
   - Default level configurable in settings.py
   - Supports DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL levels

3. Integrated logging in main game:
   - Added comprehensive logging throughout game initialization
   - Added logging for game state changes
   - Added error logging with stack traces
   - Added debug logging for game events

4. Updated settings:
   - Added logging configuration to settings.py
   - Defined default log level and format
   - Maintained existing game settings

5. Implemented view logging:
   - Added logging to all view classes (StartupView, GalaxyView, SystemView, PlanetView)
   - Logged view transitions and state changes
   - Logged user input handling (keyboard/mouse)
   - Logged error conditions and edge cases
   - Removed verbose drawing logs for better performance

### Usage
Run the game with optional log level:
```bash
python galaxy_conquest.py  # Uses default INFO level
python galaxy_conquest.py --log-level DEBUG  # For detailed debug output
```

### Next Steps
1. Add logging to remaining game modules (resources, star_system)
2. Consider adding file-based logging option
3. Add logging for performance metrics
4. Add logging for network operations (if implemented)

### Implementation Details
- Log Format: `%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s`
- Date Format: `%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S`
- Default Level: INFO
- Output: Standard output (stdout)
- Key Events Logged:
  * Game initialization and cleanup
  * State transitions
  * Star system generation
  * Save/load operations
  * Error handling with stack traces
  * View transitions and user interactions
  * Input events (keyboard/mouse)
  * Menu actions and selections
