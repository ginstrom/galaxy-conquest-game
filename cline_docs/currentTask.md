## Current Objective
Create a debug console in the top of the screen using pygame UI

## Context
The game needs a debug console that can be toggled with the backtick key (`) and hidden with the ESC key. This console will be implemented using pygame_gui elements and will be positioned at the top of the screen.

## Status
✅ Completed tasks:
- Enhanced the existing Debug class in game/debug.py to include console functionality
- Added pygame_gui elements for text input and output
- Implemented key handling for toggling the console with backtick key and hiding with ESC key
- Integrated the debug console with the Game class
- Added basic command processing (help, clear, toggle)
- Updated codebaseSummary.md to document the changes

## Implementation Details
1. Enhanced the Debug class in game/debug.py:
   - Added UI elements for console input and output
   - Implemented toggle_console, show_console, and hide_console methods
   - Added event handling for backtick and ESC keys
   - Added command processing for basic commands

2. Added new functions to game/debug.py:
   - set_ui_manager: Sets the UI manager for the debug console
   - handle_debug_event: Handles events for the debug console
   - toggle_console: Toggles the debug console visibility

3. Modified Game class in game/game.py:
   - Imported the new debug functions
   - Set the UI manager for the debug console
   - Added event handling for the debug console

## Next Steps
- Add more commands to the debug console
- Add the ability to execute Python code in the console
- Add a command history feature

## Previous Objective
Fix error on load: AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'orbit_number'

## Context
The game was crashing with an error when loading a saved game. The error occurred in the `draw_system_view` method of the `StarSystem` class when trying to access the `orbit_number` attribute of a planet object. The error message indicated that the planet was a dictionary object rather than a `Planet` object with the expected attributes.

The error trace showed:
```
File "/Users/r-ginstrom/Documents/Cline/galaxy-conquest-game/galaxy_conquest.py", line 36, in <module>
    main(sys.argv)
File "/Users/r-ginstrom/Documents/Cline/galaxy-conquest-game/galaxy_conquest.py", line 33, in main
    game.run()
File "/Users/r-ginstrom/Documents/Cline/galaxy-conquest-game/game/game.py", line 349, in run
    self.current_view.draw(self.screen)

    self.game.selected_system.draw_system_view(screen)
File "/Users/r-ginstrom/Documents/Cline/galaxy-conquest-game/game/star_system.py", line 181, in draw_system_view
    orbit_radius = 100 + planet.orbit_number * 60
AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'orbit_number'
```

## Status
✅ Completed tasks:
- Examined the `star_system.py` file to understand the `draw_system_view` method
- Checked the `planet.py` file to understand the `Planet` class and its methods
- Investigated the `persistence.py` file to see how planets are saved and loaded
- Identified the issue: When loading a saved game, planet dictionaries were not being converted back to `Planet` objects
- Fixed the issue by:
  1. Importing the `Planet` class in `persistence.py`
  2. Modifying the `load_game_state` function to convert planet dictionaries to `Planet` objects using the `Planet.from_dict` method
  3. Updating the `convert_planet_data` function to handle both dictionary and list formats for resources

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by an incomplete implementation of the game state loading process. When saving the game, planet objects were properly converted to dictionaries for JSON serialization. However, when loading the game, these dictionaries were not being converted back to `Planet` objects.

The `Planet` class has a `from_dict` method specifically designed for this purpose, but it wasn't being used in the `load_game_state` function. This resulted in the game trying to use dictionary objects as if they were `Planet` objects, leading to the `AttributeError` when accessing the `orbit_number` attribute.

## Next Steps
- Add unit tests for the `load_game_state` function to ensure it properly converts dictionaries to `Planet` objects
- Review other parts of the codebase that might have similar issues with object serialization and deserialization
- Consider adding a more comprehensive validation step when loading game state to catch potential issues before they cause runtime errors
