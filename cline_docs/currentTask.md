## Current Objective
Improve test coverage for the `game/views` directory.

## Context
We have identified several modules in the `game/views` directory with lower test coverage than our target threshold. Specifically, `galaxy.py` (52%), `hover_utils.py` (73%), `planet.py` (78%), and `system.py` (60%) need additional tests to improve coverage. The `infopanel.py` file already has 100% coverage.

## Completed Tasks
1. Created comprehensive test suite for `hover_utils.py`:
   - Added tests for `check_hover` function with various scenarios
   - Added tests for `is_within_circle` function with different object types
   - Covered edge cases like missing center coordinates or radius

2. Created comprehensive test suite for `galaxy.py`:
   - Added tests for `GalaxyView` initialization
   - Added tests for key handling (escape and other keys)
   - Added tests for mouse click handling (left and right clicks)
   - Added tests for drawing in different game states

3. Created comprehensive test suite for `system.py`:
   - Added tests for `SystemView` initialization
   - Added tests for key handling (escape and other keys)
   - Added tests for mouse click handling (clicks on planets and outside planets)
   - Added tests for the update method (hover detection)
   - Added tests for drawing in different game states

4. Created comprehensive test suite for `planet.py`:
   - Added tests for `PlanetView` initialization
   - Added tests for key handling (escape and other keys)
   - Added tests for mouse click handling (clicks in different areas)
   - Added tests for drawing with and without a selected planet

## Impact
- Improved test coverage for the `game/views` directory
- Better verification of key game interactions like hover detection, selection, and state transitions
- Enhanced ability to detect regressions in view components
- More comprehensive testing of edge cases and error conditions

## Next Steps
1. Run the coverage report to verify the improved test coverage
2. Address any remaining gaps in test coverage
3. Consider adding integration tests for interactions between different view components
4. Update documentation to reflect the improved test coverage
