## Current Objective
Completed: Move the `Game` class from galaxy_conquest.py to a new file `game/game.py`.

## Context
The `Game` class was previously defined in the main `galaxy_conquest.py` file. To improve code organization and maintainability, we moved it to a dedicated file in the game module. The `Game` class is only referenced in galaxy_conquest.py, so this refactoring was straightforward.

## Completed Steps
1. Created a new file `game/game.py`
2. Moved the `Game` class from `galaxy_conquest.py` to `game/game.py`
3. Added necessary imports to `game/game.py`
4. Updated `galaxy_conquest.py` to import the `Game` class from `game/game.py`
5. Updated imports in `tests/test_game.py` to reference the new location
6. Ran tests to ensure everything works correctly
7. Updated documentation in project_structure.md to reflect the new structure
8. Updated codebaseSummary.md and projectRoadmap.md with the changes

## Impact
- Improved code organization with the `Game` class in its own module
- Better separation of concerns between the main script and the game logic
- Consistent with the project's modular structure
- No functional changes to the game behavior
- All tests pass with 81% code coverage (above the 80% target)

## Next Steps
1. Continue with the next task in the project roadmap
2. Consider refactoring other large classes into their own modules if needed
3. Look for opportunities to improve test coverage for the Game class (currently at 33%)
