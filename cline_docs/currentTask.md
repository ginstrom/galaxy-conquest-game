## Current Objective
Fix the bootstrap command in the Makefile to work with the system architecture

## Context
The bootstrap command was failing due to compilation issues with pygame on the system. We needed to modify the project to use pygame-ce (Community Edition) instead, which is more compatible with the system architecture.

## Status
✅ Completed tasks:
- Fixed the bootstrap command by switching from pygame to pygame-ce
  - Updated pyproject.toml to use pygame-ce instead of pygame
  - Added SDL2 installation check to the bootstrap command
  - Updated installation documentation to mention SDL2 requirement
- Successfully tested the game with pygame-ce
  - Discovered that pygame-ce installs as "pygame" module
  - Reverted import statements to use "import pygame" instead of "import pygame_ce as pygame"
  - Verified that the game runs correctly with pygame-ce
- Updated documentation to reflect the changes
  - Updated techStack.md to list pygame-ce instead of pygame
  - Updated codebaseSummary.md to document the changes
  - Updated installation.md with SDL2 installation instructions

## Implementation Details
1. Identified the issue:
   - The bootstrap command was failing because pygame 2.1.3 couldn't compile on the system
   - The error was related to architecture-specific headers in the SDL2 library

2. Fixed the dependency:
   - Changed the dependency in pyproject.toml from pygame 2.1.3 to pygame-ce 2.5.3
   - pygame-ce is the Community Edition of pygame with better compatibility
   - Added SDL2 installation check to the bootstrap command

3. Updated the codebase:
   - Initially created a script (update_imports.py) to update all imports to use pygame_ce
   - Discovered that pygame-ce installs as "pygame" module, not "pygame_ce"
   - Created a script (revert_imports.py) to revert back to using "import pygame"
   - Verified that the game runs correctly with pygame-ce

4. Updated documentation:
   - Updated techStack.md to reflect the change to pygame-ce
   - Added entries to codebaseSummary.md to document the changes
   - Updated installation.md with SDL2 installation instructions
   - Updated currentTask.md with details of the implementation

## Next Steps
- Consider adding more comprehensive error handling in the bootstrap command
- Add automated tests for the bootstrap command
- Consider creating a script to check for and install dependencies

## Implementation Details
1. Added a bootstrap command to the Makefile:
   - Added checks for Python 3.10+ using `python3 -c "import sys; assert sys.version_info >= (3, 10)"`
   - Added checks for Poetry installation using `command -v poetry`
   - Added creation of the saves directory using `mkdir -p saves`
   - Added configuration setup by copying prefs.toml.example to prefs.toml if it doesn't exist
   - Added helpful error messages and success confirmation

2. Created a prefs.toml.example file:
   - Based on the existing prefs.toml file
   - Added comments to explain each setting
   - Used default values appropriate for new installations

3. Updated installation documentation:
   - Added information about the bootstrap command
   - Listed what the bootstrap command does
   - Updated the recommended installation process to use bootstrap
   - Kept the manual installation instructions as an alternative

4. Updated the help target in the Makefile:
   - Added the bootstrap command to the list of available targets
   - Added a description of what the bootstrap command does

## Next Steps
- Consider adding a .python-version file for pyenv compatibility (already done)
- Add a poetry.lock file to the repository for reproducible builds
- Update CI/CD pipelines to use Poetry (if applicable)
- Consider adding pre-commit hooks for code formatting and linting

## Previous Objective
Change the project configuration to use Poetry and Python 3.10

## Context
The project currently uses pip with requirements.txt and requirements-dev.txt files for dependency management. We need to migrate to Poetry for better dependency management and specify Python 3.10 as the required Python version.

## Status
✅ Completed tasks:
- Created pyproject.toml file with Poetry configuration
  - Set Python 3.10 as the required version
  - Included all dependencies from requirements.txt and requirements-dev.txt
  - Added build system configuration for Poetry
- Updated the Makefile to use Poetry commands
  - Replaced pip install commands with poetry install
  - Updated the virtual environment activation to use poetry shell
  - Updated the run and test commands to use poetry run
- Updated installation documentation
  - Added Poetry installation instructions
  - Updated setup and run instructions to use Poetry
- Updated techStack.md to reflect the new dependency management system
- Updated codebaseSummary.md to document the changes

## Implementation Details
1. Created pyproject.toml file:
   - Set Python 3.10 as the required version with `python = "^3.10"`
   - Included all dependencies from requirements.txt and requirements-dev.txt
   - Added build system configuration for Poetry
   - Added a script entry point for the game

2. Updated the Makefile:
   - Replaced venv-based commands with Poetry commands
   - Changed setup target to use `poetry install`
   - Updated run target to use `poetry run python galaxy_conquest.py`
   - Updated test and coverage targets to use Poetry
   - Added a shell target to activate the Poetry shell
   - Updated the clean target to remove Poetry environments

3. Updated installation documentation:
   - Added Poetry installation instructions for different operating systems
   - Updated setup and run instructions to use Poetry
   - Added troubleshooting section for Poetry-specific issues

4. Updated techStack.md:
   - Changed Python version requirement to 3.10+
   - Added Poetry as a development tool
   - Added a new section for dependency management
   - Updated the testing environment section to mention Poetry

## Previous Objective
Make the debug console's `_console_output` text area scrollable.

## Context
The debug console's output area is implemented as a `pygame_gui.elements.UITextBox` in the `game.debug.Debug` class. Currently, when a lot of text is added to the console, older text becomes inaccessible as there's no scrolling functionality. We need to modify the UITextBox initialization to enable scrolling.

## Status
✅ Completed tasks:
- Modified the `_initialize_console` method to enable scrolling for the `_console_output` UITextBox
- Added auto-scrolling to show the latest content when new text is added to the console
- Added a `test_scroll` command to test the scrolling functionality
- Updated codebaseSummary.md to document the changes

## Implementation Details
1. Updated the `_initialize_console` method in the `Debug` class:
   - Added an object_id parameter to the UITextBox constructor for potential future styling
   - Explicitly set the vertical_scrollbar property to True to enable scrolling

2. Enhanced the `_add_to_console` method:
   - Added code to automatically scroll to the bottom when new text is added
   - Used the scroll bar's bottom_limit attribute to set the scroll position to the bottom

3. Added a new `test_scroll` command:
   - Added the command to the help text
   - Implemented the command to add 30 lines of text to demonstrate scrolling
   - Added a confirmation message at the end to indicate the test is complete

## Testing
The scrolling functionality can be tested by:
1. Running the game
2. Opening the debug console with the backtick (`) key
3. Typing "test_scroll" and pressing Enter
4. Verifying that the console shows a scrollbar and allows scrolling through all the test lines

## Next Steps
- Consider adding more debug commands that might be useful for development and testing
- Add keyboard shortcuts for scrolling through console history (up/down arrows)
- Consider adding tab completion for commands
