## Current Objective
Refactor info panel code into a proper view class

## Context
The info panel code was previously part of the Game class, but needed to be moved into its own view module to match the architecture of other UI components.

## Changes Made
1. Created new InfoPanel class in game/views/infopanel.py:
   - Follows standard view interface (draw, handle_input, handle_click, handle_keydown)
   - Takes Game instance in constructor to access required state
   - Manages its own panel dimensions and rendering logic
   - Maintains consistent behavior with original implementation

2. Updated Game class:
   - Removed draw_info_panel method
   - Removed info_panel.panel_rect attribute
   - Added info_panel instance in __init__
   - Updated game loop to use info_panel.draw()

3. Updated game/views/__init__.py:
   - Added InfoPanel import
   - Added InfoPanel to __all__ list

## Impact
- Improved code organization by following the established view module pattern
- Reduced coupling between Game class and info panel rendering logic
- Made info panel code more maintainable and consistent with other views

## Next Steps
1. Consider adding interactive features to info panel in the future
2. Add unit tests for InfoPanel class
3. Consider adding documentation for the view interface pattern

## Recent Updates
Fixed test failures after info panel refactoring:
1. Updated GalaxyView to use info_panel.panel_width instead of accessing info_panel_width directly from Game class
2. Removed redundant info panel drawing call from GalaxyView (now handled in game loop)
3. Ensured proper separation of concerns between Game, InfoPanel, and GalaxyView classes

## Test Status
- Fixed AttributeError in test_game_initialization, test_menu_creation, and test_resource_loading
- Tests now properly reflect the new InfoPanel architecture
