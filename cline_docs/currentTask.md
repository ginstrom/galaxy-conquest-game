3. ✅ Added a separator line between system information and planet details
4. ✅ Maintained consistency with the SystemViewInfoPanel display style
5. ✅ Ran tests to verify all functionality works correctly
6. ✅ Updated documentation in codebaseSummary.md and projectRoadmap.md

## Next Steps
1. Consider adding more detailed planet information in the planet view
2. Explore adding interactive elements to the info panel
3. Improve visual styling of the info panel for better readability
