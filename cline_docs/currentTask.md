## Current Objective
Make the README more concise and split out detailed information into further docs in a `docs` directory.

## Context
The current README.md file contains comprehensive information about the project, but it's quite lengthy. Following the documentation management guidelines, we need to make the README more concise while moving detailed information into separate documentation files within a `docs` directory.

## Plan
1. Create a `docs` directory in the project root if it doesn't already exist
2. Create the following documentation files in the `docs` directory:
   - `installation.md`: Detailed installation and development setup instructions
   - `project_structure.md`: Detailed project structure and file descriptions
   - `configuration.md`: Detailed configuration options and instructions
   - `testing.md`: Detailed testing instructions and guidelines
   - `contributing.md`: Detailed contributing guidelines
   - `license.md`: License information

3. Update the README.md file to:
   - Retain a brief project overview, key features, and basic installation instructions
   - Include links to detailed documentation files in the `docs` directory

## Impact
- More concise README that provides essential information at a glance
- Better organized documentation with detailed information in dedicated files
- Improved maintainability of documentation
- Follows documentation management best practices

## Next Steps
1. Check if the `docs` directory already exists, create it if needed
2. Create the detailed documentation files in the `docs` directory
3. Update the README.md file to be more concise with links to the detailed docs
4. Update codebaseSummary.md to reflect the documentation changes
